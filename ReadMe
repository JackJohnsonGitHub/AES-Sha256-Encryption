included is a file named File please use this to test the program. However any file will work.

Usage
First run the 
	python3 sha256.key *your password*
This creates a private_key.bin file which is a sha256 hash of your password. 

Next run the 
	python3 AES-encrypt.py *file name you want to encrypt* en
This creates a encrypted_files.txt file which is the encrypted text of the file you wanted to encrypt\

For decryption its very simple
First make sure you have the same key as when you created the file. If not use the 
	python3 sha256.key *the password you used to create the file*
This will make a new private_key.bin file

Now run the 
	python3 AES-encrypt.py encrypted_files.txt dn
This will decrypt the encrypted file and make a new file named decrypted_file.txt
